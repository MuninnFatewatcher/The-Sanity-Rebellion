# The Insurrection

On January 6, 2021, Congress was in session to count the electoral votes. Normally, this is a formality thing and goes essentially unnoticed by the citizens of the US. Usually, the votes are counted, the number of electorates are calculated, and the loser concedes the election within a matter of days. Everything else just happens quietly, largely behind the scenes.

This election, though, as many of us who have been paying attention anticipated, Donald Trump did not concede when he lost. Instead, he has spent the past two months (more, actually) convincing his base that the election was rigged and that he really won, and the election was stolen from him.

And his base believes it.

So much so, in fact, that on that Wednesday that Congress was about to count the electoral votes, Trump and his team were outside in front of a crowd of several thousand people, where Trump once again insisted that he won and that he will never concede, and how the country has been "under seige," spends several minutes repeating the lies about voter fraud and talking about how Congress needs "a show of strength" and how "today, we will drain the swamp." He concludes with this:

> As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country. We have overwhelming pride in this great country, and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements still wait. I think one of our great achievements will be election security, because nobody, until I came along, had any idea how corrupt our elections were. And again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in the evening and say: "I want to thank you very much" and they go off to some other life. But I said: something's wrong here. Something's really wrong, can't have happened, and we fight. **We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.** Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun, my fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country, and I say this despite all that's happened: the best is yet to come.

...And then proceeds to say "let's go over there!"

Combined with the past several months of crying stolen election, and several other "opening" speakers before Trump -- including Rudy Gulliani talking something about "trial by combat," it becomes pretty predictable about what happened next.

## Breaking In

After reaching the Capitol, the crowd proceeds to break in. First, they break through the barricades, then they break several windows. At some point, Capitol police end up just letting them in at each step, overwhelmed by the number of people and lack of  reinforcements (DoD denied mobilizing National Guard until the insurrection was well underway, regional police also weren't there, it was only Capitol Police for the first several hours).

Several hundred people flood into the Capitol building. Between them vandalizing everything and Capitol police setting up barricades, the place is wrecked. A woman gets shot as she tries to climb through the window of a barricaded door, computers (among other things) are stolen.

Congress is evacuated by the time the insurrectionists reach the inner chambers.

Eventually, Capitol police are able to take it back. Weirdly, though, they only make a relative handful of arrests. Most of the people walk free.

## Aftermath

Gotta love the Internet, though. Between Twitter and Reddit (and probably Facebook and other social media sites), a ton of footage has been released, analyzed, and backed up. And the more that comes out, the more alarming things get.

First, there's "zip tie guy," whose name is an understatement. Not only is he photographed with zip cuffs, but he's in full gear. Bulletproof vest, full face mask, hat, gloves, heavy boots, gun. The Twitter crew analyzes every inch of him and someone eventually got a positive ID on him.

Then, more and more footage of people who similarly know what they're doing (full gear to thwart identification, etc) and even paramilitary groups come out. More information about the lack of security also starts emerging.

Lastly, indicators of another such "event" being planned for Inauguration Day are starting to show up.

## Thoughts

What's astounding to me are the number of people who don't understand the gravity of the situation.

Immediately, the Trump supporters started trying to pin it on [[Antifa]], and are still trying to, despite the insurrectionists themselves bragging about it with what amount to videoed confessions (and, as more people are identified and arrested, more are shown to be Trump supporters). That was expected, though.

What I find particularly disturbing is the number of people that don't believe it was a coup attempt, or that Trump and his crew incited even the riot. This despite the fact that high-ranking officials everywhere agree that he did.
