# Twenty-sixteen

They technically didn't _start_ in 2016, but that's when things took a noticeable dark turn, at least for those of us attuned to the subtleties of Trump's tactics. I still don't understand how anyone can stand him, let alone think he's fit for presidency.

At first, I didn't have much of an opinion about Trump. I'd grown up hearing about him a little bit. Something something real estate mogul, something something _The Apprentice_. At first, I thought it was a joke when he announced he was running for president. I figured he'd get bored and quit after the sort of "hold my beer" type of novelty wore off. Suffice it to say, that didn't happen.

As the months went on, my opinion of him dropped a little. He didn't seem to have a platform, he didn't seem to make much sense, and he was about a vapid as most of the other candidates.

In July, though, that changed. Two of his campaign rallies really stuck with me and sat about as well as bad milk. The first was in Colorado, the second was in Ohio. In both rallies, the campaign had chosen venues knowing the limitations on crowd size and despite having other options (or booking farther ahead of time) and signing contracts agreeing to said sizes. They then proceeded to sell more tickets than the allowed occupancy, then accused the host city and their fire marshals of political sabotage and "probably a Democrat."

Already, he was pitting people against one another (a tactic that became not only a hallmark of his campaign, but of his presidency). But what I found most disturbing was the fact that he had zero qualms with knowingly and deliberately putting his own supporters in potentially dangerous situations (another hallmark, it turned out, come 2020) so that he could play the victim. What was astounding to me was that no one else -- especially not his supporters -- seemed bothered by this fact.
