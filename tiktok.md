# TikTok

TikTok is a mobile application ("app") owned by Chinese company ByteDance.

Its Chinese ownership is of note here, because the US and China are on...tenuous terms, politically. The US is vehemently anti anything that even sniffs of socialism, while China is a socialist country. Trump has used this culture to further anti-Chinese xenophobia for reasons I'm not entirely clear on (perhaps it's nothing more than that he's just a racist asshole).

Interestingly, China isn't really an antagonistic country toward us. We mutually rely on each other's trade and associated agreements.
