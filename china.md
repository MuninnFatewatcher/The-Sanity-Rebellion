# China

(Specifically, relationships between the US and China.)

Historically, Chinese-American relations have been...complex. It's probably best described as an "on again, off again" relationship.

By the end of the Obama administration, we were on decent terms, with China being a rather large trade partner. Not _great_ (NASA was barred from working with CNSA in 2011), but decent.

Trump spent the subesquent four years dismantling that relationship, with sewing anti-Chinese propaganda from the beginning, culminating in an all-out trade war starting from about 2018.
