# Deliberately Endangering His Own Supporters

Like the incidents in [[twenty-sixteen]], Trump did a sort of...encore of endangering his own supporters during is 2020 campaign for re-election.

This time, however, it was by risking further spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus (aka "[[Covid-19]]" or just "Covid"). After months of downplaying the threat of the virus and the illness it causes, refusing to wear a mask, even insisting on shaking hands with people (an action he _for decades_ did not do as a result of being a well-known germaphobe), he scheduled several rallies in various cities in an attempt to get as large a crowd as possible. 

One such rally that didn't get cancelled or delayed by the host city was Tulsa. 6,200 people showed up (after [[TikTok]] users trolled the campaign by signing up in droves; gods bless today's teens -- not even out of high school and already they're over this shit), and in an effort to make it seem more crowded than it actually was, were sat in close proximity to each other.
