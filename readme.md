# Memory

I start this in the year 2020. 244 years since the creation of this country. 75 years since the death of Adolf Hitler and the fall of Nazi Germany. 29 years since the fall of the Soviet Union.

Those numbers seem significant now, eight months into this nightmare of a year, the capstone year of a surreal presidential cycle, genuinely not knowing if the next election will even happen, or if we have fallen to [[fascism]].

2020 may very well be the year historians look back on as the fall of the United States, the same way they look back on the destruction of the Roman Republic and the rising of Roman Empire under the First Triumvirate. Or the way the geeks at the intersection of historical politics and sci-fi look at _Star Wars_.

George Orwell's _1984_ was supposed to be a warning. _Star Wars_ was supposed to be a warning (even if its creators didn't fully realize it). _Hunger Games_, _Animal Farm_, _Brave New World_, _Harry Potter_, _Black Mirror_. "Satire" these are considered -- criticisms of the twisted realities in which they take place. Warnings.

_Not_ handbooks.

And yet, here I am, like Anne Frank and her peers three-quarters of a century ago, starting a journal to record as much as I can about this, because gaslighting fucks with perceptions of reality, and we need records of how things are, so that when our society pulls through the dark times that may very well be ahead, historians may be able to untwist somewhat the events that happened.

Unlike Anne Frank, I (for now, at least) have access to more than just a paper notebook. Instead, I can put this up for the world to see and for others like me to contribute to, and most importantly, to create backup after backup after backup to prevent it from being lost to time. Instead of just a linear journal, I can build a web of interlinked information. With any luck, I won't be alone on this and those like me will contribute their own thoughts and memories to this. Perhaps it can be used to piece together all the little tendrils of everything that's been going on and provide some semblance of a picture of what's going on and how this all happened.
