# Axios Interview

Hoo boy... this interview was...something else. And painful. The only thing that makes it bearable to watch for _any_ length of time are Swan's expressions.

Trump starts by saying "this has never happened before" (it might not have been a Coronavirus, but pandemics...aren't exactly uncommon, and while this is a fair bit more virulent, it has proven to be mitigated by many of the same social mitigations as the Spanish Flu pandemic).

Then he gets into his usual bit about being the best off and how very few are doing better than we are (provably false) and we're handling this so well (we aren't) and that he "closed down the greatest economy ever in history" (he didn't).

Then he claims his Tulsa rally had 12,000 people (and, like a round of _Groundhog Day_, Fox News and the Trump campaign insisted that the fire marshal was wrong and biased and blah blah blah when he put the count at 6,200). The stadium holds 19,000. 12,000 would be an obvious difference from 6,200. And of course it was "the highest rating ever!" on Fox. :eyeroll:

...Swan had asked about the public health matter of such a crowd. He completely ignored that part of the question.

At the time of the interview, the death toll was at 140,000 people, with 1,000 dying each day.

Trump insisted that "it's under control as much as you can control it. Yeah, people are dying, that's true. And it is what it is."

Meanwhile...on his Twitter feed in the previous months are all-caps Tweets about "liberating" various states whose governors had shut down and done some sort of mask recommendation (not even requirement in most places), because Trump refused to do so.

And what about testing, Mr. President?

"We have great testing!" (At the time of the recording, tests were generally only being administered to people being admitted to the hospital with symptoms consistent with Covid-19 and in most places, the turnaround time for running the tests was a week or more, even in the places where they were obtainable outside of hospitals.)

"And there are those that say you can test too much. You do know that."

....what? Who says that?

"Oh, just read the manuals, read the books."

Manuals? What books?

...and he's on to something about how we've tested more people than anyone one else and other countries only test when someone's sick and I'm sure his base ate it up hook, line, and sinker.

And he tries claiming credit, because "when I took over, we didn't even have a test."

...for a virus that didn't exist until the end of 2019.

"There was no test for this. We didn't have a test because there was no test."

Yes Ducky, that's generally how that works.

"The point is, because we are so much better at testing than any other country in the world, we show more cases."

...that's _not_ how that works... (He doubles down on this later in the interview, with "And, because we do more tests, we have more cases.")

"A kid with a runny nose" might have gotten tested earlier this year (not actually likely unless there were other symptoms), but it would have only been "a case" _if the kid tested positive_. That's how tests work. Me getting tested for strep throat doesn't mean I _have_ strep until the test actually comes back and confirms it (likewise, not every sore throat is strep).

Then there's this lovely gem:

Jonathan Swan: (14:14)
Oh. It’s surely a relevant statistic to say, if the U.S. has X population and X percentage of death of that population versus South Korea-

President Donald J. Trump: (14:22)
No. Because you have to go by the cases.

Jonathan Swan: (14:22)
Well, look at South Korea, for example. 51 million population, 300 deaths. It’s like, it’s crazy compared to-

President Donald J. Trump: (14:28)
You don’t know that.

Jonathan Swan: (14:29)
I do.

President Donald J. Trump: (14:30)
You don’t know that.

Jonathan Swan: (14:31)
You think they’re faking their statistics, South Korea? An advanced country?

President Donald J. Trump: (14:33)
I won’t get into that because I have a very good relationship with the country.

Not "I don't think they're faking it." "I'm not getting into that, because we're political allies."

Yeah...Trump's not xenophobic _at all_.

And the interview _goes on and on_ in this barely coherent manner. At one point, they're talking about Russia and he triest to change the topic to China, because...nuclear proliferation?

Yes, China has nuclear capability. So does Russia. You know...the country that's _actively_ hostile to the US and _actively_ tampered with our last presidential election and is _actively_ running bot and troll accounts to spread disinformation and destabilize our country? The one selling weapons to the Taliban?

Oh. That's right. You won't do anything, because you're beholden to them with millions and millions of debt. That you've been covering up.

This is also the same person that reads his daily intelligence brief at least two or three times a week, usually.

The rest of the interview is barely coherent and more of him getting stuck on repeat about something or other he's claimed to do better than anyone else ever or how the circumstances he's facing have never been seen in the history of the world ever before. It's painful to even read, really.
