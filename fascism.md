# Fascism

The US Holocaust Memorial Museum has a list of the early warning signs of fascism:

1. Powerful and continuing nationalism
2. Disdain for human rights
3. Identification of enemies as a unifying cause
4. Rampant sexism
5. Controlled mass media
6. Obsession with national security
7. Religion and government intertwined
8. Corporate power protected
9. Labor power suppressed
10. Disdain for intellectual and the arts
11. Obsession with crime and punishment
12. Rampant cronyism and corruption

"America first"

"Fake news"

"Grab her by the pussy"

I don't know if Hitler ever said anything like that third one, but the first two are straight out of the Nazi playbook. Many sources I found that list these 12 signs also link to one or more things that are basically the poster child examples for the item.

To be fair, not everything on the list was _started_ by Trump. There are cases to be made for numbers 7, 8, and 9 in particular to predate him. Those cases likely wouldn't be wrong, but that just means we've been going down this road for far longer than most people would still like to admit.

Right after the election results, author Amy Siskind started writing [weekly lists](https://theweeklylist.org/weekly-list/) to document the eroding norms and the warping sense of what's "normal." Looking back through the original Medium posts, it's actually kind of disturbing that comments dropped off after about a year, despite the fact that a not-small percentage were origianlly rather mocking (to put it nicely) of her work, almost moreso than the fact that the lists themselves proceeded to lengthen with each passing week.
